# MTBeDRIVE

This is a eMTB motor-controller hardware repository. The concept is a uniform powerstage, with a standardized MCU pinmap.
The goal is to make a modular controller, which is able to easily swap bulk capacitors. Having the MCU (Micro Controller/Drivers/Step_down etc.) 
on a seperate layer from the powerstage, optimizes and focuses the cooling on the powerstage, being directly attached to a heatsink. 

You can say, the design seek´s a slim and compackt expresion, becource it is specifically designed with a MTB conversion in mind.
